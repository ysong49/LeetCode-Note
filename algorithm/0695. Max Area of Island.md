## 695. Max Area of Island [M]
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

 

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/maxarea1-grid.jpg)
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
 ```

#### Constraints:
- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 50
- grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

            for (int j = 0; j < map[i].length; j ++) {
                res = Math.max(res, helper(i, j, 0));
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
    
    private int helper(int i, int j, int currSize) {
        if (i == map.length || i == -1 || j == map[i].length || j == -1 || map[i][j] == 0) {
            return currSize;
        }
        currSize ++;
        map[i][j] = 0;
        
        currSize += helper(i + 1, j, 0);
        currSize += helper(i - 1, j, 0);
        currSize += helper(i, j + 1, 0);
        currSize += helper(i, j - 1, 0);
        
        return currSize;
    }
}
