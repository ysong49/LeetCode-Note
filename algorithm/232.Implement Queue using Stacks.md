# 232. Implement Queue using Stacks [E]
Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks. 
```
push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue. 
pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue. 
peek() -- Get the front element. 
empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty. 
```
# Notes:
- You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
- You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).

# Code:
```c++
class Queue 
{
public:
    // Push element x to the back of queue.
    void push(int x) {
        stack<int> temp;
        while (s.size() != 0)
        {
            temp.push(s.top());
            s.pop();
        }
        s.push(x);
        while (temp.size() != 0)
        {
            s.push(temp.top());
            temp.pop();
        }
    }

    // Removes the element from in front of queue.
    void pop(void) {
        s.pop();
    }

    // Get the front element.
    int peek(void) {
        return s.top();
    }

    // Return whether the queue is empty.
    bool empty(void) {
        return s.size() == 0;
    }
    
private:
    stack<int> s;
};
```
