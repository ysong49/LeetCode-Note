## 395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters [M]
Find the length of the longest substring **T** of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in **T** appears no less than k times.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
s = "aaabb", k = 3

Output:
3
```
The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
s = "ababbc", k = 2

Output:
5
```
The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.

                if (isValid(s.substr(i, length), k))
                    return length;
        return 0;
    }

    bool isValid(string s, int k) {
        vector<int> buckets(26, 0);
        for (char c : s) 
            buckets[c - 'a'] ++;
        for (int bucket : buckets)
            if (bucket != 0 && bucket < k)
                return false;
        return true;
    }
};
