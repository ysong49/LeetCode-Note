## 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree [H]
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

For example, you may serialize the following tree
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5
```
as `"[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"`, just the same as [how LeetCode OJ serializes a binary tree](https://leetcode.com/faq/#binary-tree). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

            }

        for (int i = 0; i < data.size(); i ++) {
            int start = i;
            while (data[i] != ',')
                i ++;
            string substr = data.substr(start, i - start);
            if (substr == "#")
                nodes.push_back(nullptr);
            else
                nodes.push_back(new TreeNode(stoi(substr)));
        }
        q.push(nodes.front());

            node->left = nodes[++count];
            node->right = nodes[++count];
            q.push(node->left);
