## 243. Shortest Word Distance [E]
Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

For example,   
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.

Given word1 = `“coding”`, word2 = `“practice”`, return 3.   
Given word1 = `"makes"`, word2 = `"coding"`, return 1.

#### Note:
You may assume that word1 **does not** equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.

    int shortestDistance(vector<string>& words, string word1, string word2) 
    {
        int min_dis = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i ++)
        {
            if (words[i] == word1)
                for (int j = i + 1; j < words.size(); j ++)
                    if (words[j] == word2)
                    {
                        min_dis = min(min_dis, j - i);
                        break;
                    }
            else if (words[i] == word2)
                for (int j = i + 1; j < words.size(); j ++)
                    if (words[j] == word1)
                    {
                        min_dis = min(min_dis, j - i);
                        break;
                    }
        }
        return min_dis;
    }
