## 281. Zigzag Iterator [M]
Given two 1d vectors, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

For example, given two 1d vectors:
```
v1 = [1, 2]
v2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]
```
By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns `false`, the order of elements returned by next should be: `[1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6]`.

**Follow up**: What if you are given k 1d vectors? How well can your code be extended to such cases?

#### Clarification for the follow up question - Update (2015-09-18):
The "Zigzag" order is not clearly defined and is ambiguous for `k > 2` cases. If "Zigzag" does not look right to you, replace "Zigzag" with "Cyclic". For example, given the following input:
```
[1,2,3]
[4,5,6,7]
[8,9]
```
It should return `[1,4,8,2,5,9,3,6,7]`.

## Code:
```c++
class ZigzagIterator 
{
    // date: 2016-08-25     location: Santa CLara City Library
private:
    vector<int> v1, v2;
    int i = 0, j = 0;
public:
    ZigzagIterator(vector<int>& _v1, vector<int>& _v2) 
    {
        v1 = _v1, v2 = _v2;
    }

    int next() 
    {
        if (i == v1.size())     return v2[j ++];
        if (j == v2.size())     return v1[i ++];
        if (i == j)     return v1[i ++];
        return v2[j ++];
    }

    bool hasNext() 
    {
        return i < v1.size() || j < v2.size();
    }
};

/**
 * Your ZigzagIterator object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * ZigzagIterator i(v1, v2);
 * while (i.hasNext()) cout << i.next();
 */
 ```
