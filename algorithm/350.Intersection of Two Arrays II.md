# 350. Intersection of Two Arrays II [E]
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

Example:
```
Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2, 2].
```

# Note:
Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.

The result can be in any order.

# Follow up:
- What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
- What if nums1's size is small compared to num2's size? Which algorithm is better?
- What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

# Code:
```c++
class Solution 
{
public:
    vector<int> intersect(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) 
    {
        sort (nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
        sort (nums2.begin(), nums2.end());
        
        vector<int> ans;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        
        while (i < nums1.size() && j < nums2.size())
        {
            if (nums1[i] == nums2[j])
            {
                ans.push_back(nums1[i]);
                i ++;
                nums2.erase(nums2.begin() + j);
            }
            else if (nums1[i] < nums2[j])
                i ++;
            else
                j ++;
        }
        
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
