## 89. Gray Code [M]
The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

For example, given n = 2, return `[0,1,3,2]`. Its gray code sequence is:
```
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2
```
#### Note:
For a given n, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.

For example, `[0,2,3,1]` is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.

For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.

        }
        
        return res;
