## 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes [M]
Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Definition of a complete binary tree from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees):  
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

### Code:
- Solution 1 - brute force (Time Limit Exceeded):
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) 
    {
        int count = 0;
        helper(root, count);
        return count;
    }
    
    void helper(TreeNode* node, int& count)
    {
        if (!node)
            return;
        
        count ++;
        helper(node -> left, count);
        helper(node -> right, count);
    }
};
```

- Solution 2 - improved recursive way (325 ms):
```c++
class Solution 
{
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) 
    {
        if(!root) 
            return 0;

        int hl = 0, hr = 0;
        TreeNode *l = root, *r = root;
        while(l) 
        {
            hl ++;
            l = l -> left;
        }
        while(r) 
        {
            hr ++;
            r = r -> right;
        }

        if(hl == hr) 
            return pow(2, hl)-1;

        return 1 + countNodes(root -> left) + countNodes(root -> right);
    }
};
```
