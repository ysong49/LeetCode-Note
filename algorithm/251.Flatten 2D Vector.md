## 251. Flatten 2D Vector [M]
Implement an iterator to flatten a 2d vector.

For example,
Given 2d vector =
```
[
  [1,2],
  [3],
  [4,5,6]
]
```
By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`.

#### Hint:
  1. How many variables do you need to keep track?
  2. Two variables is all you need. Try with `x` and `y`.
  3. Beware of empty rows. It could be the first few rows.
  4. To write correct code, think about the [invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(computer_science)) to maintain. What is it?
  5. The invariant is `x` and `y` must always point to a valid point in the 2d vector. Should you maintain your invariant ahead of time or right when you need it?
  6. Not sure? Think about how you would implement `hasNext()`. Which is more complex?
  7. Common logic in two different places should be refactored into a common method.
  
#### Follow up:
As an added challenge, try to code it using only iterators in C++ or iterators in Java.

## Code:
- Solution 1 - convert the 2d vector to a 1d vector in the constructor (16 ms):
```c++
class Vector2D 
{
    // date: 2016-09-08     location: Santa Clara City Library
    vector<int> nums;
    int count = 0;
public:
    Vector2D(vector<vector<int>>& vec2d) 
    {
        for (auto vec : vec2d)
            for (auto num : vec)
                nums.push_back(num);
        count = 0;
    }

    int next() 
    {
        return nums[count ++];
    }

    bool hasNext() 
    {
        return count < nums.size();
    }
};

/**
 * Your Vector2D object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Vector2D i(vec2d);
 * while (i.hasNext()) cout << i.next();
 */
 ```
 
- Solution 2 - using only x and y (23 ms):
```c++
class Vector2D 
{
    // date: 2016-09-08     location: Santa Clara City Library
    vector<vector<int>> nums;
    int i, j;
public:
    Vector2D(vector<vector<int>>& vec2d) 
    {
        nums = vec2d;
        i = 0, j = -1;
    }

    int next() 
    {
        return nums[i][j];
    }

    bool hasNext() 
    {
        if (i == nums.size())
            return false;
        else if (j + 1 < nums[i].size())
        {
            j ++;
            return true;
        }
        else if (j + 1 == nums[i].size())
        {
            i ++;
            while (i < nums.size() && nums[i].empty())
                i ++;
            if (i == nums.size())
                return false;
            j = 0;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};

/**
 * Your Vector2D object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Vector2D i(vec2d);
 * while (i.hasNext()) cout << i.next();
 */
```

- Solution 3 - using only c++ iterator (19 ms):
```c++
class Vector2D 
{
    // date: 2016-09-08     location: Santa Clara City Library
    vector<vector<int>> nums;
    vector<vector<int>>::iterator i;
    vector<int>::iterator j;
public:
    Vector2D(vector<vector<int>>& vec2d) 
    {
        nums = vec2d;
        i = nums.begin();
        if (!nums.empty())
            j = nums.front().begin() - 1;
    }

    int next() 
    {
        return *j;
    }

    bool hasNext() 
    {
        if (i == nums.end())
            return false;
        else if (j + 1 != (*i).end())
        {
            j ++;
            return true;
        }
        else if (j + 1 == (*i).end())
        {
            i ++;
            while (i != nums.end() && (*i).empty())
                i ++;
            if (i == nums.end())
                return false;
            j = (*i).begin();
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};

/**
 * Your Vector2D object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Vector2D i(vec2d);
 * while (i.hasNext()) cout << i.next();
 */
```
