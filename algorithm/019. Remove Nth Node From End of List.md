## 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List [E]
Given a linked list, remove the n ^ th node from the end of list and return its head.

For example,
```
   Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

   After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

##### Note:
- Given n will always be valid.
- Try to do this in one pass.

```c++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */

public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) 
    {
        ListNode *prev_head = new ListNode(0), *fast = prev_head, *slow = prev_head;
        prev_head -> next = head;
        while (n -- && fast)
            fast = fast -> next;
        while (fast -> next)
        {
            fast = fast -> next;
            slow = slow -> next;
        }
        slow -> next = slow -> next -> next;
        return prev_head -> next;
    }
};
```
