## 338. Counting Bits [M]
Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

**Example:**
For `num = 5` you should return `[0,1,1,2,1,2]`.

**Follow up:**
- It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
- Space complexity should be O(n).
- Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.

**Hint:**
  1. You should make use of what you have produced already.
  2. Divide the numbers in ranges like [2-3], [4-7], [8-15] and so on. And try to generate new range from previous.
  3. Or does the odd/even status of the number help you in calculating the number of 1s?


## Code:
- dp (63 ms)
```c++
class Solution {
    // 2nd round        date: 2016-10-28        location: Vista Del Lago III 
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int num) {
        vector<int> dp(num + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 1; i < num + 1; i ++) 
            dp[i] = dp[i / 2] + (i % 2);
        return dp;
    }
};
```
