## 63. Unique Paths II [M]
Follow up for ["Unique Paths"](https://github.com/ysong49/LeetCode-Note/blob/master/algorithm/062.Unique%20Paths.md):

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

For example,
There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.
```
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
```
The total number of unique paths is `2`.

**Note**: m and n will be at most 100.

## Code:
```c++
class Solution 
{
    // date: 2016-09-02     location: Vista Del Lago III Apartments
public:
    int uniquePathsWithObstacles(vector<vector<int>>& obstacleGrid)
    {
        int m = obstacleGrid.size(), n = obstacleGrid.front().size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i ++)
        {
            if (obstacleGrid[i][0])     break;
            dp[i][0] = 1;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j ++)
        {
            if (obstacleGrid[0][j])     break;
            dp[0][j] = 1;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i ++)
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j ++)
                dp[i][j] = (obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1) ? 0 : dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
        
        return dp.back().back();
    }
};
```
