## 159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters [H]
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most 2 distinct characters.

For example, Given s = `“eceba”`,

T is "ece" which its length is 3.

## Code:
- Solution 1 - two pointers ():
```c++

```

- Solution 2 - using ASC II code to store the pprevious character (8 ms):
```c++
class Solution 
{
    // date: 2016-08-26     location: Santa Clara City Library
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(string s) 
    {
        vector<int> store(256, 0);
        int start = 0, length = 1, count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i ++)
        {
            store[s[i]] ++;
            if (store[s[i]] == 1)
            {
                count ++;
                while (count > 2)
                {
                    store[s[start]] --;
                    if (store[s[start]] == 0)   count --;
                    start ++;
                }
            }
            length = max(length, i - start + 1);
        }
        
        return length;
    }
};
```
