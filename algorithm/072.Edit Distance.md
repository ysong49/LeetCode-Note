## 72. Edit Distance [H]
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:   
  a) Insert a character   
  b) Delete a character   
  c) Replace a character   
  
## Wrong Code:
Before I wrote this code, I did not get the right function to get dp[i][j]. And the reason of why I did not get the right function is I did not figure out what are dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1] and dp[i - 1][j - 1] represent for.
```c++
class Solution 
{
    // date: 2016-09-07     location: Santa Clara City Library
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) 
    {
        int m = word1.size() + 1, n = word2.size() + 1;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i ++)
            dp[i][0] = i;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i ++)
            dp[0][i] = i;
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i ++)
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j ++)
            {
                if (dp[i - 1][j] == dp[i][j - 1])
                {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                    if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1])
                        dp[i][j] --;
                }
                else
                {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                    if (word1[i - 1] != word2[j - 1])
                        dp[i][j] ++;
                }
            }
        return dp.back().back();
    }
};
```
  
  
## Code:
f(i, j) := minimum cost (or steps) required to convert first i characters of word1 to first j characters of word2

Case 1: word1[i] == word2[j], i.e. the ith the jth character matches.
```
f(i, j) = f(i - 1, j - 1)
```
Case 2: word1[i] != word2[j], then we must either insert, delete or replace, whichever is cheaper
```
f(i, j) = 1 + min { f(i, j - 1), f(i - 1, j), f(i - 1, j - 1) }
```
    1. f(i, j - 1) represents insert operation
    2. f(i - 1, j) represents delete operation
    3. f(i - 1, j - 1) represents replace operation
