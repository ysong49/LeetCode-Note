## 286. Walls and Gates [M]
You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

1. `-1` - A wall or an obstacle.
2. `0` - A gate.
3. `INF` - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value `2^31 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with `INF`.

For example, given the 2D grid:
```
    INF  -1  0  INF
    INF INF INF  -1
    INF  -1 INF  -1
      0  -1 INF INF
```
After running your function, the 2D grid should be:
```
    3  -1   0   1
    2   2   1  -1
    1  -1   2  -1
    0  -1   3   4
```

## Code:
```c++
class Solution 
{
    // date: 2016-08-05     location: Santa Clara City Library
public:
    void wallsAndGates(vector<vector<int>>& rooms) 
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < rooms.size(); i ++)
            for (int j = 0; j < rooms[0].size(); j ++)
                if (rooms[i][j] == 0)
                    helper(i, j, 1, rooms);
    }
    
    void helper(int i, int j, int step, vector<vector<int>>& rooms)
    {
        if (i > 0 && rooms[i - 1][j] > step)
        {
            rooms[i - 1][j] = step;
            helper(i - 1, j, step + 1, rooms);
        }
        if (j > 0 && rooms[i][j - 1] > step)
        {
            rooms[i][j - 1] = step;
            helper(i, j - 1, step + 1, rooms);
        }
        if (i < rooms.size() - 1 && rooms[i + 1][j] > step)
        {
            rooms[i + 1][j] = step;
            helper(i + 1, j, step + 1, rooms);
        }
        if (j < rooms[0].size() - 1 && rooms[i][j + 1] > step)
        {
            rooms[i][j + 1] = step;
            helper(i, j + 1, step + 1, rooms);
        }
    }
};
```
