    int numWays(int n, int k) 
    {
        if (n == 0 || k == 0)
            return 0;
        if (n == 1)   
            return k;
        int first = k, second = k * k, third;
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i ++)
        {
            third = (k - 1) * (first + second);
            first = second;
            second = third;
        }
        return second;
    }
