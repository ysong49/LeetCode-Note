## 133. Clone Graph [M]
Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a `label` and a list of its `neighbors`.   


#### OJ's undirected graph serialization:   
Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use `#` as a separator for each node, and `,` as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.   
As an example, consider the serialized graph `{0,1,2#1,2#2,2}`.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by `#`.

  1. First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
  2. Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
  3. Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
  
Visually, the graph looks like the following:   
```
       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/
```

 *     vector<UndirectedGraphNode *> neighbors;
 *     UndirectedGraphNode(int x) : label(x) {};
 * };

    unordered_map<UndirectedGraphNode*, UndirectedGraphNode*> reflect;
public:
    UndirectedGraphNode *cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode *node) 
    {
        if (!node)  return node;
        if (reflect.count(node) == 0)
        {
            reflect[node] = new UndirectedGraphNode(node -> label);
            for (auto neighbor : node -> neighbors)
                (reflect[node] -> neighbors).push_back(cloneGraph(neighbor));
        }
        return reflect[node];
    }

```

        s.push(node);
        while (!s.empty()) {
            UndirectedGraphNode *curr = s.top();
            s.pop();
            if (map.count(curr) == 0) 
                map[curr] = new UndirectedGraphNode(curr->label);
            for (auto neighbor : curr->neighbors)
                if (map.count(neighbor) == 0)
