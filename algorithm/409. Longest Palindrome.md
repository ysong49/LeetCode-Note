## 409. Longest Palindrome [E]
Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.

This is case sensitive, for example `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

#### Note:
Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.

#### Example:
```
Input:
"abccccdd"

Output:
7

Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```

## Code:
- bucket sort (3 ms):
```c++
class Solution {
    // date: 2016-10-10     location: SJSU Student Union
public:
    int longestPalindrome(string s) {
        vector<int> buckets(128, 0);
        for (auto c : s)
            buckets[c] ++;
        int res= 0, hasOdd = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 128; i ++) 
            if (buckets[i] % 2 == 0) {
                res += buckets[i];
            } else {
                hasOdd = 1;
                res += buckets[i] - 1;
            }
        return hasOdd ? res + 1 : res;
    }
};
```
