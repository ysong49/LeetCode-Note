## 263. Ugly Number [E]
Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number. 

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`. For example, `6, 8` are ugly while `14` is not ugly since it includes another prime factor `7`. 

### Note:
1 is typically treated as an ugly number. 


### Code:
```c++
class Solution 
{
public:
    bool isUgly(int num) 
    {
        if (num == 1)
            return true;
        if (num == 0)
            return false;
            
        while (num % 2 == 0)
            num = num / 2;
        while (num % 3 == 0)
            num = num / 3;
        while (num % 5 == 0)
            num = num / 5;
            
        return num == 1 ? true : false;
    }
};
```
