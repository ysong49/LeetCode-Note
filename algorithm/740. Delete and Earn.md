## 740. Delete and Earn [M]
You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

- Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.
Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.

 

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.
```

#### Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 104

java DP
```java
class Solution {
    public int deleteAndEarn(int[] nums) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>(nums.length);
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (map.containsKey(num)) {
                map.put(num, map.get(num) + 1);
            } else {
                map.put(num, 1);
            }
            list.add(num);
        }
        list = list.stream().distinct().sorted().collect(Collectors.toList());
        
        int[][] temp = new int[2][list.size()];
        temp[0][0] = list.get(0) * map.get(list.get(0));
        temp[1][0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < list.size(); i ++) {
            if (list.get(i) == list.get(i - 1) + 1) {
                temp[0][i] = list.get(i) * map.get(list.get(i)) + temp[1][i -1];
                temp[1][i] = Math.max(temp[0][i -1], temp[1][i -1]);
            } else {
                temp[0][i] = list.get(i) * map.get(list.get(i)) + Math.max(temp[0][i -1], temp[1][i -1]);
                temp[1][i] = Math.max(temp[0][i -1], temp[1][i -1]);
            }
        }
        
        return Math.max(temp[0][list.size() -1], temp[1][list.size() -1]);
    }
}
```
