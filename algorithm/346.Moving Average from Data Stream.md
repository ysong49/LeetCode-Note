## 346. Moving Average from Data Stream [E]
Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

For example,
MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
```
    m.next(1) = 1
    m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2
    m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
    m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3
```

## Code:
```c++
class MovingAverage 
{
    queue<int> q;
    int _size;
    double sum;
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    MovingAverage(int size) 
    {
        _size = size;
        sum = 0;
    }
    
    double next(int val) 
    {
        sum += val;
        q.push(val);
        if (q.size() > _size)
        {
            sum -= q.front();
            q.pop();
        }
        return sum / q.size();
    }
};

/**
 * Your MovingAverage object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MovingAverage obj = new MovingAverage(size);
 * double param_1 = obj.next(val);
 */
 ```
