# 16. 3Sum Closest [M]
Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

```java
    For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.

    The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

# Analysis:
Sort the vector and then no need to run O(N^3) algorithm as each index has a direction to move.

The code starts from this formation.
```
----------------------------------------------------
^  ^                                               ^
|  |                                               |
|  +- second                                     third
+-first
```

if nums[first] + nums[second] + nums[third] is smaller than the target, we know we have to increase the sum. so only choice is moving the second index forward.
```
----------------------------------------------------
^    ^                                             ^
|    |                                             |
|    +- second                                   third
+-first
```

if the sum is bigger than the target, we know that we need to reduce the sum. so only choice is moving 'third' to backward. of course if the sum equals to target, we can immediately return the sum.
```
----------------------------------------------------
^    ^                                          ^
|    |                                          |
|    +- second                                third
+-first
```

when second and third cross, the round is done so start next round by moving 'first' and resetting second and third.
```
----------------------------------------------------
  ^    ^                                           ^
  |    |                                           |
  |    +- second                                 third
  +-first
  ```
  
while doing this, collect the closest sum of each stage by calculating and comparing delta. Compare abs(target-newSum) and abs(target-closest). At the end of the process the three indexes will eventually be gathered at the end of the array.
```
----------------------------------------------------
                                         ^    ^    ^
                                         |    |    `- third
                                         |    +- second
                                         +-first
```
if no exactly matching sum has been found so far, the value in closest will be the answer.

# Code:
```c++
class Solution 
{
public:
    int threeSumClosest(vector<int>& nums, int target) 
    {
        if (nums.size() < 3)
            return 0;
            
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int second, thrid, ans = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2], size = nums.size(), sum;
        
        for (int first = 0; first < size - 2; first ++)
        {
            if(first > 0 && nums[first] == nums[first-1]) 
                continue;
            second = first + 1;
            thrid = size - 1;
            while (second < thrid)
            {
                sum = nums[first] + nums[second] + nums[thrid];
                if (sum == target)
                    return sum;
                else if (abs(target - sum) < abs(target - ans))
                    ans = sum;
                else if (sum > target)
                    thrid --;
                else
                    second ++;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
