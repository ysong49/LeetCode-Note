# 11. Container With Most Water [M]

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container.

# Note: 
You may not slant the container.

# Code:
``` c++
class Solution 
{
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) 
    {
        int begin = 0, end = height.size() - 1, ans = 0;
        while (begin <= end)
        {
            ans = max(ans, min(height[begin], height[end]) * (end - begin));
            // if (height[begin] <= height[end])
            //     begin ++;
            // else
            //     end --;
            height[begin] <= height[end] ? begin ++ : end --;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
