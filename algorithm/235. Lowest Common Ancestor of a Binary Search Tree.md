## 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree [E]
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to [the definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”
```

   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
```
For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

### Round 2
- Solution 1 - common way, which can be applied to any binary tree (14 ms):
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution 
{
    // 2nd round        date: 2016-09-21        location: Vista Del Lago III Apartments
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) 
    {
        if (!root || root == p || root == q)    return root;
        TreeNode* fromLeft = lowestCommonAncestor(root -> left, p, q);
        TreeNode* fromRight = lowestCommonAncestor(root -> right, p, q);
        if (fromLeft && fromRight)
            return root;
        return fromLeft ? fromLeft : fromRight;
    }
};
```

- Solution 2 - using `val` of the binary search tree (40 ms):
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution 
{
    // 2nd round        date: 2016-09-21        location: Vista Del Lago III Apartments
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) 
    {
        if (!root || !p || !q)  
            return nullptr;
        if (p -> val < root -> val && q -> val < root -> val)
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root -> left, p, q);
        if (p -> val > root -> val && q -> val > root -> val)
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root -> right, p, q);
        return root;
    }
};
```
