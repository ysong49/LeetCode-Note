## 293. Flip Game [E]
You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.

For example, given s = "++++", after one move, it may become one of the following states:

```
    [
      "--++",
      "+--+",
      "++--"
    ]
```
If there is no valid move, return an empty list `[]`.

## Code:
```c++
class Solution 
{
public:
    vector<string> generatePossibleNextMoves(string s) 
    {
        vector<string> res;
        if (s == "")    return res;
        string original = s, temp;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size() - 1; i ++)
        {
            temp = s;
            if (temp[i] == '+' && temp[i + 1] == '+')
            {
                temp[i] = '-';
                temp[i + 1] = '-';
                res.push_back(temp);
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```
