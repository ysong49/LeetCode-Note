## 157. Read N Characters Given Read4 [E]
The API: `int read4(char *buf)` reads 4 characters at a time from a file.

The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.

By using the `read4` API, implement the function `int read(char *buf, int n)` that reads n characters from the file.

- The read function will only be called once for each test case.

## Code:
```c++
// Forward declaration of the read4 API.
int read4(char *buf);

class Solution 
{
    // date: 2016-08-03     location: Santa Clara City Library
public:
    /**
     * @param buf Destination buffer
     * @param n   Maximum number of characters to read
     * @return    The number of characters read
     */
    int read(char *buf, int n) 
    {
        int res = 0, times = n / 4;
        for (int i = 0, curr = 1; i <= times && curr != 0; i ++)
        {
            curr = read4(buf + res);
            res += curr;
        }
        
        return min(res, n);
    }
};
```
