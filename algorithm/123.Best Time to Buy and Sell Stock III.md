## 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III [H]
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

#### Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

## Code:
- Solution 1 - DP, using only 1 2D vector (Time Limit Exceeded):
```
  Time Complexity: O(k * n ^ 2)     k is the # of transations, m is the length of "vector<int> prices".
  
  This solution worked fine when n is less than 1000.
```
```c++
class Solution 
{
    // date: 2016-09-17     location: Santa Clara City Library
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) 
    {
        if (prices.empty())     return 0;

        vector<vector<int>> profits(3, vector<int>(prices.size(), 0));
        for (int i = 1; i < 3; i ++)
            for (int j = 1; j < prices.size(); j ++)
            {
                int _max = 0;
                for (int k = 0; k < j; k ++)
                    _max = max(profits[i - 1][k] + prices[j] - prices[k], _max);
                profits[i][j] = max(_max, profits[i][j - 1]);
            }
            
        return profits.back().back();
    }
};
```
