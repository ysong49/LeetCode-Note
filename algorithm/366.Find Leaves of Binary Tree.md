## 366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree [M]
Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this: Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.

##### Example:
Given binary tree 
```
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5   
```
Returns `[4, 5, 3], [2], [1]`.

##### Explanation:
1. Removing the leaves `[4, 5, 3]` would result in this tree:
```
          1
         / 
        2      
```
2. Now removing the leaf `[2]` would result in this tree:
```
          1     
```
3. Now removing the leaf `[1]` would result in the empty tree:
```
          []       
```
Returns `[4, 5, 3], [2], [1]`.

## Code:
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };

public:
    vector<vector<int>> findLeaves(TreeNode* root) 
    {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        helper(root, res);
        return res;
    }
    
    int helper(TreeNode* node, vector<vector<int>>& res)
    {
        if (!node)  return 0;
        int level = max(helper(node -> left, res), helper(node -> right, res));
        if (level == res.size())
            res.push_back({});
        res[level].push_back(node -> val);
        return level + 1;
    }
};
```
