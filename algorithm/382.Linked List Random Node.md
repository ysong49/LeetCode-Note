## 382. Linked List Random Node [H]
Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. Each node must have the **same probability** of being chosen.

##### Follow up:
- What if the linked list is extremely large and its length is unknown to you?   
- Could you solve this efficiently without using extra space?   

#####Example:
```
// Init a singly linked list [1,2,3].
ListNode head = new ListNode(1);
head.next = new ListNode(2);
head.next.next = new ListNode(3);
Solution solution = new Solution(head);

// getRandom() should return either 1, 2, or 3 randomly. Each element should have equal probability of returning.
solution.getRandom();
```

## Code:
```c++
class Solution 
{
    // date: 2016-08-09     location: Santa Clara City Library
    int length = 0;
    ListNode* _head;
public:
    /** @param head The linked list's head. Note that the head is guanranteed to be not null, so it contains at least one node. */
    Solution(ListNode* head) 
    {
        _head = head;
        while (head)
        {
            length ++;
            head = head -> next;
        }
    }
    
    /** Returns a random node's value. */
    int getRandom() 
    {
        int random = rand() % length;
        ListNode* node = _head;
        for (int i = 0; i < random; i ++)
            node = node -> next;
        return node -> val;
    }
};

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution obj = new Solution(head);
 * int param_1 = obj.getRandom();
 */
 ```
