## 62. Unique Paths [M]
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Above is a 3 x 7 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

**Note:** m and n will be at most 100.

## Code:
```c++
class Solution 
{
    // date: 2016-09-02     location: Vista Del Lago III Apartments
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) 
    {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 1));
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i ++)
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j ++)
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
        
        return dp.back().back();
    }
};
```
