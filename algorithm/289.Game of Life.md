## 289. Game of Life [M]
According to the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)'s article: "**The Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a board with `m` by `n` cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

  1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
  2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
  3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
  4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state.   

#### Follow up: 
  1. Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
  2. In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?

## Code:
```c++
class Solution 
{
    // date: 2016-09-08     location: Santa Clara City Library
public:
    void gameOfLife(vector<vector<int>>& board) 
    {
        vector<vector<int>> res = board;
        for (int i = 0; i < board.size(); i ++)
            for (int j = 0; j < board.front().size(); j ++)
                helper(board, res, i, j);
        board = res;
    }

private:
    vector<vector<int>> direction = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {1, 1}, {1, -1}, {-1, 1}, {-1, -1}}; 
    void helper(vector<vector<int>>& board, vector<vector<int>>& res, int i, int j)
    {
        int dead = 0, live = 0;
        for (int k = 0; k < direction.size(); k ++)
        {
            int new_i = i + direction[k][0], new_j = j + direction[k][1];
            if (new_i < 0 || new_j < 0 || new_i >= board.size() || new_j >= board.front().size())
                continue;
            if (board[new_i][new_j] == 1)   live ++;
            else                            dead ++;
        }
        if (live < 2 || live > 3)
            res[i][j] = 0;
        if (board[i][j] == 0 && live == 3)
            res[i][j] = 1;
    }
};
```
