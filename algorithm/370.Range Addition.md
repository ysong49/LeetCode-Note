## 370. Range Addition [M]
Assume you have an array of length n initialized with all 0's and are given k update operations.

Each operation is represented as a triplet: **[startIndex, endIndex, inc]** which increments each element of subarray **A[startIndex ... endIndex]** (startIndex and endIndex inclusive) with inc.

Return the modified array after all k operations were executed.

##### Example:
```
Given:

    length = 5,
    updates = [
        [1,  3,  2],
        [2,  4,  3],
        [0,  2, -2]
    ]

Output:

    [-2, 0, 3, 5, 3]
```

##### Explanation:
```
    Initial state:
    [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
    
    After applying operation [1, 3, 2]:
    [ 0, 2, 2, 2, 0 ]
    
    After applying operation [2, 4, 3]:
    [ 0, 2, 5, 5, 3 ]
    
    After applying operation [0, 2, -2]:
    [-2, 0, 3, 5, 3 ]
```
##### Hint:   
1. Thinking of using advanced data structures? You are thinking it too complicated.
2. For each update operation, do you really need to update all elements between i and j?
3. Update only the first and end element is sufficient.
4. The optimal time complexity is O(k + n) and uses O(1) extra space.

## Code:
- Solution 1 - update all elements between the first and last elements (Time Limit Exceeded):
```c++
class Solution 
{
    // date: 2016-07-26     location: Santa Clara City Library
public:
    vector<int> getModifiedArray(int length, vector<vector<int>>& updates) 
    {
        // without the trick, the processing time will exceed the limited time.
        vector<int> res(length, 0);
        for (auto v : updates)
        {
            for (int i = v[0]; i <= v[1]; i ++)
                res[i] += v[2];
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```

- Solution 2 - only update the first and last element (163 ms):
```c++
class Solution 
{
public:
    vector<int> getModifiedArray(int length, vector<vector<int>>& updates) 
    {
        // according to the hints, only updates the first and last element.
        // these updates means the difference between this element and the previous element. 
        vector<int> res, temp(length + 1, 0);
        for (auto update : updates)
        {
            temp[update[0]] += update[2];
            temp[update[1] + 1] -= update[2];
        }
        
        res.push_back(temp[0]);
        for (int i = 1; i < length; i ++)
            res.push_back(res[i - 1] + temp[i]);
        
        return res;
    }
};
```
