## 265. Paint House II [H]
There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a `n x k` cost matrix. For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

**Note**: All costs are positive integers.

**Follow up**: Could you solve it in O(nk) runtime?

## Code:
```c++
class Solution 
{
    // date: 2016-09-03     location: Santa Clara City Library
public:
    int minCostII(vector<vector<int>>& costs) 
    {
        if (costs.empty())    return 0;
        vector<vector<int>> dp = costs;
        for (int i = 1; i < dp.size(); i ++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < costs.front().size(); j ++)
            {
                int _min = INT_MAX;
                for (int k = 0; k < costs.front().size(); k ++)
                    if (k != j)
                        _min = min(_min, dp[i - 1][k]);
                dp[i][j] += _min;
            }
        }
        int res = INT_MAX;
        for (int k = 0; k < costs.front().size(); k ++)
            res = min(res, dp.back()[k]);
        return res;
    }
};
