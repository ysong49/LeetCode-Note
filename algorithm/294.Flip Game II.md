## 294. Flip Game II [M]
You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.

For example, given `s = "++++"`, return true. The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle `"++"` to become `"+--+"`.

## Code:
```c++
class Solution 
{
public:
    bool canWin(string s) 
    {
        if (s == "")    return false;
        return helper(s);
    }
    
    bool helper(string s)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size() - 1; i ++)
            if (s[i] == '+' && s[i + 1] == '+')
            {
                s[i] = '-';
                s[i + 1] = '-';
                if (!helper(s))  return true;
                s[i] = '+';
                s[i + 1] = '+';
            }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```
