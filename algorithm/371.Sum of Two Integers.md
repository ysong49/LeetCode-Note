## 371. Sum of Two Integers [E]
Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

##### Example:
Given a = 1 and b = 2, return 3. 


### Code:
```c++
class Solution 
{
public:
    int getSum(int a, int b) 
    {
        int sum = b;
        while (b)
        {
            sum = a ^ b;
            b = (a & b) << 1;
            a = sum;
        }
        
        return a;
    }
};
```
