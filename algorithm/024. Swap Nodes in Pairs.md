## 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs [E]
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

For example,
Given `1->2->3->4`, you should return the list as `2->1->4->3`.

Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may **not** modify the values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.

## Code:

```c++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution 
{
    // 2nd round        date: 2016-10-03        location: Santa Clara Central Park Library
public:
    ListNode* swapPairs(ListNode* head) 
    {
        if (!head || !head -> next)     return head;
        ListNode* prev_head = new ListNode(0), *prev = prev_head, *curr = head, *next = curr -> next;
        prev_head -> next = head;
        while (curr && next)
        {
            prev -> next = next;
            curr -> next = next -> next;
            next -> next = curr;
            
            prev = curr;
            curr = curr -> next;
            next = curr ? curr -> next : nullptr;
        }
        return prev_head -> next;
    }
};
```
