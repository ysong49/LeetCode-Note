## 287. Find the Duplicate Number [M]
Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Note:**   
  1. You must **not** modify the array (assume the array is read only).
  2. You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
  3. Your runtime complexity should be less than `O(n2)`.
  4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

```c++
class Solution {
    // 2nd round        date: 2016-10-31        location: Vista Del Lago III 
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i = 1, j = nums.size() - 1, mid, count;
        while (i < j) {
            mid = i + (j - i) / 2, count = 0;
            for (num : nums)   
                if (num <= mid)
                    count ++;
            if (count <= mid)   
                i = mid + 1;
            else
                j = mid;
        }
        return i;
    }
};
```
