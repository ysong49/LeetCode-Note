## 419. Battleships in a Board [M]
Given an 2D board, count how many different battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with 'X's, empty slots are represented with '.'s. You may assume the following rules:

- You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
- Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.
- At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.   

**Example:**
```
X..X
...X
...X
```
In the above board there are 2 battleships.   
**Invalid Example:**   
```
...X
XXXX
...X
```

This is not a valid board - as battleships will always have a cell separating between them.  
**Your algorithm should not modify the value of the board.   **

```c++
class Solution {

public:
    int countBattleships(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        vector<vector<char>> replace = board;
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < board.size(); i ++)
            for (int j = 0; j < board.front().size(); j ++) 
                if (replace[i][j] == 'X') {
                    res ++;
                    dfs(replace, i, j);
                }
        return res;
    }
private:
    vector<vector<int>> directions = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};
    void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& replace, int i, int j) {
        replace[i][j] = '.';
        for (int k = 0; k < 4; k ++) {
            int new_i = i + directions[k][0], new_j = j + directions[k][1];
            if (new_i < 0 || new_i >= replace.size() || new_j < 0 || new_j >= replace.front().size())
                continue;
            if (replace[new_i][new_j] == 'X')
                dfs(replace, new_i, new_j);
        }
    }
