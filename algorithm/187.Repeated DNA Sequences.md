## 187. Repeated DNA Sequences [M]
 All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

##### For example,
```
  Given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT",
  
  Return:
  ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].
```

### Code:
```c++
class Solution 
{
public:
    vector<string> findRepeatedDnaSequences(string s) 
    {
        if (s.size() < 11)
            return {};
            
        vector<string> res;
        unordered_map<string, int> m;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size() - 9; i ++)
            if (++ m[s.substr(i, 10)] == 2)
                res.push_back(s.substr(i, 10));
        
        return res;
    }
};
```
