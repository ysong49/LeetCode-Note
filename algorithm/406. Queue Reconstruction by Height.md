## 406. Queue Reconstruction by Height [M]
Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers `(h, k)`, where `h` is the height of the person and `k` is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to `h`. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

**Note:**
The number of people is less than 1,100.   

**Example**
```
Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
```

            if (a.first != b.first)
                return a.first > b.first;
            return a.second < b.second;
        });
        vector<pair<int, int>> res;
        for (auto p : people)
            res.insert(res.begin() + p.second, p);
        return res;
    }
};
```
