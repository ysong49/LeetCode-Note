## 332. Reconstruct Itinerary [M]
Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports `[from, to]`, reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `JFK`. Thus, the itinerary must begin with `JFK`.

#### Note:
  1. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.
  2. All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
  3. You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.

#### Example 1:
`tickets` = `[["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]`
Return `["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]`.

#### Example 2:
`tickets` = `[["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]`
Return `["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]`.
Another possible reconstruction is `["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"]`. But it is larger in lexical order.
