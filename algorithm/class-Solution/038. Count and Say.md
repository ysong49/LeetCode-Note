## 38. Count and Say [E]
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
`1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...`

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
`21` is read off as `"one 2, then one 1"` or `1211`.
Given an integer n, generate the n^th sequence.

Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

## Code:
### Round 2
- Solution 1 - regular method (3 ms):
```c++
class Solution {
    // 2nd round        date: 2016-10-06        location: Santa Clara Central Park Library
public:
    string countAndSay(int n) {
        string curr = "1", next = "1";
        while (-- n) {
            curr = next;
            next = "";
            for (int i = 0; i < curr.size(); i ++) {
                int count = 1;
                while (i + 1 < curr.size() && curr[i] == curr[i + 1]) {
                    i ++;
                    count ++;
                }
                next += to_string(count) + curr[i];
            }
        }
        return next;
    }
};
```

- Solution 2 - using `static vector<string>` to hold the previous result (6 ms):
```
  In this problem, the test cases is too small, the advatage of this prgram is not very obvious.
```
```c++
class Solution {
    // 2nd round        date: 2016-10-06        location: Santa Clara Central Park Library
public:
    string countAndSay(int n) {
        static vector<string> pool(1, "1");
        while (pool.size() <= n) {
            string next = "";
            for (int i = 0; i < pool.back().size(); i ++) {
                int count = 1;
                while (i + 1 < pool.back().size() && pool.back()[i] == pool.back()[i + 1]) {
                    count ++;
                    i ++;
                }
                next += to_string(count) + pool.back()[i];
            }
            pool.push_back(next);
        }
        return pool[n - 1];
    }
};
```
