## 202. Happy Number [E]
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

```
Example: 19 is a happy number

    12 + 92 = 82
    82 + 22 = 68
    62 + 82 = 100
    12 + 02 + 02 = 1 
```

## Analysis:
The whole process will end in two ways:   1. equaling to 1.
                                          2. starting a loop.

## Code:
```c++
class Solution 
{
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) 
    {
        int temp = n;
        set<int> s;
        
        while (true)
        {
            if(temp == 1)
                return true;
            if (find(s.begin(), s.end(), temp) != s.end())
                return false;
                
            s.insert(temp);
            n = temp;
            temp = 0;
            
            while (n > 0)
            {
                temp += (n % 10) * (n % 10);
                n = n / 10;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
