## 141. Linked List Cycle
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

Can you solve it without using extra space?

### Round 2 - Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm
#### Intuition

Imagine two runners running on a track at different speed. What happens when the track is actually a circle?

#### Algorithm

The space complexity can be reduced to O(1)O(1) by considering two pointers at different speed - a slow pointer and a fast pointer. The slow pointer moves one step at a time while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.

If there is no cycle in the list, the fast pointer will eventually reach the end and we can return false in this case.

Now consider a cyclic list and imagine the slow and fast pointers are two runners racing around a circle track. The fast runner will eventually meet the slow runner. Why? Consider this case (we name it case A) - The fast runner is just one step behind the slow runner. In the next iteration, they both increment one and two steps respectively and meet each other.

How about other cases? For example, we have not considered cases where the fast runner is two or three steps behind the slow runner yet. This is simple, because in the next or next's next iteration, this case will be reduced to case A mentioned above.
```c++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution 
{
    // 2nd round        date: 2016-09-22        location: Santa Clara Central Park Library
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) 
    {
        if (!head)      return false;
        ListNode *slow = head, *fast = head -> next;
        while (fast && slow != fast)
        {
            fast = fast -> next;
            if (fast)   fast = fast -> next;
            slow = slow -> next;
        }
        return fast ? true : false;
    }
};
```

### Round 3
java - hash table
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    // 3rd round        date: 2022-03-08        location: Wilburton
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) {
            return false;
        }
        
        Set<ListNode> set = new HashSet<ListNode>();
        while (head != null) {
            if (set.contains(head)) {
                return true;
            }
            set.add(head);
            head = head.next;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```
