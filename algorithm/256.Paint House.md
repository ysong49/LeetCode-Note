## 256. Paint House [M]
There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a `n x 3` cost matrix. For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

**Note**: All costs are positive integers.

## Code:
```c++
class Solution 
{
    // date: 2016-09-03     location: Santa Clara City Library
public:
    int minCost(vector<vector<int>>& costs) 
    {
        if (costs.empty())    return 0;
        vector<vector<int>> dp = costs;
        for (int i = 1; i < dp.size(); i ++)
        {
            dp[i][0] += min(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][2]);
            dp[i][1] += min(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][2]);
            dp[i][2] += min(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1]);
        }
        return min(dp.back()[0], min(dp.back()[1], dp.back()[2]));
    }
};
```
